Its syntax is similar to Perl-style regular expressions, but lacks\\na few features like look around and backreferences. In exchange, all searches\\nexecute in linear time with respect to the size of the regular expression and\\nsearch text.\\n\\nThis crate's documentation provides some simple examples, describes\\n[Unicode support](#unicode) and exhaustively lists the\\n[supported syntax](#syntax).\\n\\nFor more specific details on the API for regular expressions, please see the\\ndocumentation for the [`Regex`](struct.Regex.html) type.\\n\\n# Usage\\n\\nThis crate is [on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/regex) and can be\\nused by adding `regex` to your dependencies in your project's `Cargo.toml`.\\n\\n```toml\\n[dependencies]\\nregex = \\\"1\\\"\\n```\\n\\n# Example: find a date\\n\\nGeneral use of regular expressions in this package involves compiling an\\nexpression and then using it to search, split or replace text. For example,\\nto confirm that some text resembles a date:\\n\\n```rust\\nuse regex::Regex;\\nlet re = Regex::new(r\\\"^\\\\d{4}-\\\\d{2}-\\\\d{2}$\\\").unwrap();\\nassert!(re.is_match(\\\"2014-01-01\\\"));\\n```\\n\\nNotice the use of the `^` and `$` anchors. In this crate, every expression\\nis executed with an implicit `.*?` at the beginning and end, which allows\\nit to match anywhere in the text. Anchors can be used to ensure that the\\nfull text matches an expression.\\n\\nThis example also demonstrates the utility of\\n[raw strings](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/tokens.html#raw-string-literals)\\nin Rust, which\\nare just like regular strings except they are prefixed with an `r` and do\\nnot process any escape sequences. For example, `\\\"\\\\\\\\d\\\"` is the same\\nexpression as `r\\\"\\\\d\\\"`.\\n\\n# Example: Avoid compiling the same regex in a loop\\n\\nIt is an anti-pattern to compile the same regular expression in a loop\\nsince compilation is typically expensive. (It takes anywhere from a few\\nmicroseconds to a few **milliseconds** depending on the size of the\\nregex.) Not only is compilation itself expensive, but this also prevents\\noptimizations that reuse allocations internally to the matching engines.\\n\\nIn Rust, it can sometimes be a pain to pass regular expressions around if\\nthey're used from inside a helper function. Instead, we recommend using the\\n[`lazy_static`](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static) crate to ensure that\\nregular expressions are compiled exactly once.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```rust\\nuse lazy_static::lazy_static;\\nuse regex::Regex;\\n\\nfn some_helper_function(text: &str) -> bool {\\n    lazy_static! {\\n        static ref RE: Regex = Regex::new(\\\"...\\\").unwrap();\\n    }\\n    RE.is_match(text)\\n}\\n\\nfn main() {}\\n```\\n\\nSpecifically, in this example, the regex will be compiled when it is used for\\nthe first time. On subsequent uses, it will reuse the previous compilation.\\n\\n# Example: iterating over capture groups\\n\\nThis crate provides convenient iterators for matching an expression\\nrepeatedly against a search string to find successive non-overlapping\\nmatches. For example, to find all dates in a string and be able to access\\nthem by their component pieces:\\n\\n```rust\\nlet re = Regex::new(r\\\"(\\\\d{4})-(\\\\d{2})-(\\\\d{2})\\\").unwrap();\\nlet text = \\\"2012-03-14, 2013-01-01 and 2014-07-05\\\";\\nfor cap in re.captures_iter(text) {\\n    println!(\\\"Month: {} Day: {} Year: {}\\\", &cap[2], &cap[3], &cap[1]);\\n}\\n// Output:\\n// Month: 03 Day: 14 Year: 2012\\n// Month: 01 Day: 01 Year: 2013\\n// Month: 07 Day: 05 Year: 2014\\n```\\n\\nNotice that the year is in the capture group indexed at `1`. This is\\nbecause the *entire match* is stored in the capture group at index `0`.\\n\\n# Example: replacement with named capture groups\\n\\nBuilding on the previous example, perhaps we'd like to rearrange the date\\nformats. This can be done with text replacement. But to make the code\\nclearer, we can *name*  our capture groups and use those names as variables\\nin our replacement text:\\n\\n```rust\\nlet re = Regex::new(r\\\"(?P<y>\\\\d{4})-(?P<m>\\\\d{2})-(?P<d>\\\\d{2})\\\").unwrap();\\nlet before = \\\"2012-03-14, 2013-01-01 and 2014-07-05\\\";\\nlet after = re.replace_all(before, \\\"$m/$d/$y\\\");\\nassert_eq!(after, \\\"03/14/2012, 01/01/2013 and 07/05/2014\\\");\\n```\\n\\nThe `replace` methods are actually polymorphic in the replacement, which\\nprovides more flexibility than is seen here. (See the documentation for\\n`Regex::replace` for more details.)\\n\\nNote that if your regex gets complicated, you can use the `x` flag to\\nenable insignificant whitespace mode, which also lets you write comments:\\n\\n```rust\\nlet re = Regex::new(r\\\"(?x)\\n  (?P<y>\\\\d{4}) # the year\\n  -\\n  (?P<m>\\\\d{2}) # the month\\n  -\\n  (?P<d>\\\\d{2}) # the day\\n\\\").unwrap();\\nlet before = \\\"2012-03-14, 2013-01-01 and 2014-07-05\\\";\\nlet after = re.replace_all(before, \\\"$m/$d/$y\\\");\\nassert_eq!(after, \\\"03/14/2012, 01/01/2013 and 07/05/2014\\\");\\n```\\n\\nIf you wish to match against whitespace in this mode, you can still use `\\\\s`,\\n`\\\\n`, `\\\\t`, etc. For escaping a single space character, you can escape it\\ndirectly with `\\\\ `, use its hex character code `\\\\x20` or temporarily disable\\nthe `x` flag, e.g., `(?-x: )`.\\n\\n# Example: match multiple regular expressions simultaneously\\n\\nThis demonstrates how to use a `RegexSet` to match multiple (possibly\\noverlapping) regular expressions in a single scan of the search text:\\n\\n```rust\\nuse regex::RegexSet;\\n\\nlet set = RegexSet::new(&[\\n    r\\\"\\\\w+\\\",\\n    r\\\"\\\\d+\\\",\\n    r\\\"\\\\pL+\\\",\\n    r\\\"foo\\\",\\n    r\\\"bar\\\",\\n    r\\\"barfoo\\\",\\n    r\\\"foobar\\\",\\n]).unwrap();\\n\\n// Iterate over and collect all of the matches.\\nlet matches: Vec<_> = set.matches(\\\"foobar\\\").into_iter().collect();\\nassert_eq!(matches, vec![0, 2, 3, 4, 6]);\\n\\n// You can also test whether a particular regex matched:\\nlet matches = set.matches(\\\"foobar\\\");\\nassert!(!matches.matched(5));\\nassert!(matches.matched(6));\\n```\\n\\n# Pay for what you use\\n\\nWith respect to searching text with a regular expression, there are three\\nquestions that can be asked:\\n\\n1. Does the text match this expression?\\n2. If so, where does it match?\\n3. Where did the capturing groups match?\\n\\nGenerally speaking, this crate could provide a function to answer only #3,\\nwhich would subsume #1 and #2 automatically. However, it can be significantly\\nmore expensive to compute the location of capturing group matches, so it's best\\nnot to do it if you don't need to.\\n\\nTherefore, only use what you need. For example, don't use `find` if you\\nonly need to test if an expression matches a string. (Use `is_match`\\ninstead.)\\n\\n# Unicode\\n\\nThis implementation executes regular expressions **only** on valid UTF-8\\nwhile exposing match locations as byte indices into the search string. (To\\nrelax this restriction, use the [`bytes`](bytes/index.html) sub-module.)\\n\\nOnly simple case folding is supported. Namely, when matching\\ncase-insensitively, the characters are first mapped using the \\\"simple\\\" case\\nfolding rules defined by Unicode.\\n\\nRegular expressions themselves are **only** interpreted as a sequence of\\nUnicode scalar values. This means you can use Unicode characters directly\\nin your expression:\\n\\n```rust\\nlet re = Regex::new(r\\\"(?i)Δ+\\\").unwrap();\\nlet mat = re.find(\\\"ΔδΔ\\\").unwrap();\\nassert_eq!((mat.start(), mat.end()), (0, 6));\\n```\\n\\nMost features of the regular expressions in this crate are Unicode aware. Here\\nare some examples:\\n\\n* `.` will match any valid UTF-8 encoded Unicode scalar value except for `\\\\n`.\\n  (To also match `\\\\n`, enable the `s` flag, e.g., `(?s:.)`.)\\n* `\\\\w`, `\\\\d` and `\\\\s` are Unicode aware. For example, `\\\\s` will match all forms\\n  of whitespace categorized by Unicode.\\n* `\\\\b` matches a Unicode word boundary.\\n* Negated character classes like `[^a]` match all Unicode scalar values except\\n  for `a`.\\n* `^` and `$` are **not** Unicode aware in multi-line mode. Namely, they only\\n  recognize `\\\\n` and not any of the other forms of line terminators defined\\n  by Unicode.\\n\\nUnicode general categories, scripts, script extensions, ages and a smattering\\nof boolean properties are available as character classes. For example, you can\\nmatch a sequence of numerals, Greek or Cherokee letters:\\n\\n```rust\\nlet re = Regex::new(r\\\"[\\\\pN\\\\p{Greek}\\\\p{Cherokee}]+\\\").unwrap();\\nlet mat = re.find(\\\"abcΔᎠβⅠᏴγδⅡxyz\\\").unwrap();\\nassert_eq!((mat.start(), mat.end()), (3, 23));\\n```\\n\\nFor a more detailed breakdown of Unicode support with respect to\\n[UTS#18](https://unicode.org/reports/tr18/),\\nplease see the\\n[UNICODE](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/master/UNICODE.md)\\ndocument in the root of the regex repository.\\n\\n# Opt out of Unicode support\\n\\nThe `bytes` sub-module provides a `Regex` type that can be used to match\\non `&[u8]`. By default, text is interpreted as UTF-8 just like it is with\\nthe main `Regex` type. However, this behavior can be disabled by turning\\noff the `u` flag, even if doing so could result in matching invalid UTF-8.\\nFor example, when the `u` flag is disabled, `.` will match any byte instead\\nof any Unicode scalar value.\\n\\nDisabling the `u` flag is also possible with the standard `&str`-based `Regex`\\ntype, but it is only allowed where the UTF-8 invariant is maintained. For\\nexample, `(?-u:\\\\w)` is an ASCII-only `\\\\w` character class and is legal in an\\n`&str`-based `Regex`, but `(?-u:\\\\xFF)` will attempt to match the raw byte\\n`\\\\xFF`, which is invalid UTF-8 and therefore is illegal in `&str`-based\\nregexes.\\n\\nFinally, since Unicode support requires bundling large Unicode data\\ntables, this crate exposes knobs to disable the compilation of those\\ndata tables, which can be useful for shrinking binary size and reducing\\ncompilation times. For details on how to do that, see the section on [crate\\nfeatures](#crate-features).\\n\\n# Syntax\\n\\nThe syntax supported in this crate is documented below.\\n\\nNote that the regular expression parser and abstract syntax are exposed in\\na separate crate, [`regex-syntax`](https://docs.rs/regex-syntax).\\n\\n## Matching one character\\n\\n<pre class=\\\"rust\\\">\\n.             any character except new line (includes new line with s flag)\\n\\\\d            digit (\\\\p{Nd})\\n\\\\D            not digit\\n\\\\pN           One-letter name Unicode character class\\n\\\\p{Greek}     Unicode character class (general category or script)\\n\\\\PN           Negated one-letter name Unicode character class\\n\\\\P{Greek}     negated Unicode character class (general category or script)\\n</pre>\\n\\n### Character classes\\n\\n<pre class=\\\"rust\\\">\\n[xyz]         A character class matching either x, y or z (union).\\n[^xyz]        A character class matching any character except x, y and z.\\n[a-z]         A character class matching any character in range a-z.\\n[[:alpha:]]   ASCII character class ([A-Za-z])\\n[[:^alpha:]]  Negated ASCII character class ([^A-Za-z])\\n[x[^xyz]]     Nested/grouping character class (matching any character except y and z)\\n[a-y&&xyz]    Intersection (matching x or y)\\n[0-9&&[^4]]   Subtraction using intersection and negation (matching 0-9 except 4)\\n[0-9--4]      Direct subtraction (matching 0-9 except 4)\\n[a-g~~b-h]    Symmetric difference (matching `a` and `h` only)\\n[\\\\[\\\\]]        Escaping in character classes (matching [ or ])\\n</pre>\\n\\nAny named character class may appear inside a bracketed `[...]` character\\nclass.

For example, `(?x)` sets the flag `x`\\nand `(?-x)` clears the flag `x`.

This means that there\\nis a lot of code dedicated to performance, the handling of Unicode data and the\\nUnicode data itself. Overall, this leads to more dependencies, larger binaries\\nand longer compile times.  This trade off may not be appropriate in all cases,\\nand indeed, even when all Unicode and performance features are disabled, one\\nis still left with a perfectly serviceable regex engine that will work well\\nin many cases.\\n\\nThis crate exposes a number of features for controlling that trade off. Some\\nof these features are strictly performance oriented, such that disabling them\\nwon't result in a loss of functionality, but may result in worse performance.\\nOther features, such as the ones controlling the presence or absence of Unicode\\ndata, can result in a loss of functionality. For example, if one disables the\\n`unicode-case` feature (described below), then compiling the regex `(?i)a`\\nwill fail since Unicode case insensitivity is enabled by default. Instead,\\ncallers must use `(?i-u)a` instead to disable Unicode case folding. Stated\\ndifferently, enabling or disabling any of the features below can only add or\\nsubtract from the total set of valid regular expressions. Enabling or disabling\\na feature will never modify the match semantics of a regular expression.\\n\\nAll features below are enabled by default.\\n\\n### Ecosystem features\\n\\n* **std** -\\n  When enabled, this will cause `regex` to use the standard library. Currently,\\n  disabling this feature will always result in a compilation error. It is\\n  intended to add `alloc`-only support to regex in the future.\\n\\n### Performance features\\n\\n* **perf** -\\n  Enables all performance related features. This feature is enabled by default\\n  and will always cover all features that improve performance, even if more\\n  are added in the future.\\n* **perf-dfa** -\\n  Enables the use of a lazy DFA for matching. The lazy DFA is used to compile\\n  portions of a regex to a very fast DFA on an as-needed basis. This can\\n  result in substantial speedups, usually by an order of magnitude on large\\n  haystacks. The lazy DFA does not bring in any new dependencies, but it can\\n  make compile times longer.\\n* **perf-inline** -\\n  Enables the use of aggressive inlining inside match routines. This reduces\\n  the overhead of each match. The aggressive inlining, however, increases\\n  compile times and binary size.\\n* **perf-literal** -\\n  Enables the use of literal optimizations for speeding up matches. In some\\n  cases, literal optimizations can result in speedups of _several_ orders of\\n  magnitude. Disabling this drops the `aho-corasick` and `memchr` dependencies.\\n* **perf-cache** -\\n  This feature used to enable a faster internal cache at the cost of using\\n  additional dependencies, but this is no longer an option. A fast internal\\n  cache is now used unconditionally with no additional dependencies. This may\\n  change in the future.\\n\\n### Unicode features\\n\\n* **unicode** -\\n  Enables all Unicode features. This feature is enabled by default, and will\\n  always cover all Unicode features, even if more are added in the future.\\n* **unicode-age** -\\n  Provide the data for the\\n  [Unicode `Age` property](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/tr44-24.html#Character_Age).\\n  This makes it possible to use classes like `\\\\p{Age:6.0}` to refer to all\\n  codepoints first introduced in Unicode 6.0\\n* **unicode-bool** -\\n  Provide the data for numerous Unicode boolean properties. The full list\\n  is not included here, but contains properties like `Alphabetic`, `Emoji`,\\n  `Lowercase`, `Math`, `Uppercase` and `White_Space`.\\n* **unicode-case** -\\n  Provide the data for case insensitive matching using\\n  [Unicode's \\\"simple loose matches\\\" specification](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Simple_Loose_Matches).\\n* **unicode-gencat** -\\n  Provide the data for\\n  [Unicode general categories](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/tr44-24.html#General_Category_Values).\\n  This includes, but is not limited to, `Decimal_Number`, `Letter`,\\n  `Math_Symbol`, `Number` and `Punctuation`.\\n* **unicode-perl** -\\n  Provide the data for supporting the Unicode-aware Perl character classes,\\n  corresponding to `\\\\w`, `\\\\s` and `\\\\d`. This is also necessary for using\\n  Unicode-aware word boundary assertions. Note that if this feature is\\n  disabled, the `\\\\s` and `\\\\d` character classes are still available if the\\n  `unicode-bool` and `unicode-gencat` features are enabled, respectively.\\n* **unicode-script** -\\n  Provide the data for\\n  [Unicode scripts and script extensions](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/).\\n  This includes, but is not limited to, `Arabic`, `Cyrillic`, `Hebrew`,\\n  `Latin` and `Thai`.\\n* **unicode-segment** -\\n  Provide the data necessary to provide the properties used to implement the\\n  [Unicode text segmentation algorithms](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/).\\n  This enables using classes like `\\\\p{gcb=Extend}`, `\\\\p{wb=Katakana}` and\\n  `\\\\p{sb=ATerm}`.\\n\\n\\n# Untrusted input\\n\\nThis crate can handle both untrusted regular expressions and untrusted\\nsearch text.\\n\\nUntrusted regular expressions are handled by capping the size of a compiled\\nregular expression.\\n(See [`RegexBuilder::size_limit`](struct.RegexBuilder.html#method.size_limit).)\\nWithout this, it would be trivial for an attacker to exhaust your system's\\nmemory with expressions like `a{100}{100}{100}`.\\n\\nUntrusted search text is allowed because the matching engine(s) in this\\ncrate have time complexity `O(mn)` (with `m ~ regex` and `n ~ search\\ntext`), which means there's no way to cause exponential blow-up like with\\nsome other regular expression engines. (We pay for this by disallowing\\nfeatures like arbitrary look-ahead and backreferences.)\\n\\nWhen a DFA is used, pathological cases with exponential state blow-up are\\navoided by constructing the DFA lazily or in an \\\"online\\\" manner. Therefore,\\nat most one new state can be created for each byte of input. This satisfies\\nour time complexity guarantees, but can lead to memory growth\\nproportional to the size of the input. As a stopgap, the DFA is only\\nallowed to store a fixed number of states. When the limit is reached, its\\nstates are wiped and continues on, possibly duplicating previous work. If\\nthe limit is reached too frequently, it gives up and hands control off to\\nanother matching engine with fixed memory requirements.\\n(The DFA size limit can also be tweaked. See\\n[`RegexBuilder::dfa_size_limit`](struct.RegexBuilder.html#method.dfa_size_limit).)\"},\"additionalTextEdits\":[],\"sortText\":\"ffffffef\",\"filterText\":\"regex\",\"labelDetails\":{},\"textEdit\":{\"newText\":\"regex\",\"insert\":{\"start\":{\"character\":20,\"line\":26},\"end\":{\"character\":23,\"line\":26}},\"replace\":{\"start\":{\"character\":20,\"line\":26},\"end\":{\"character\":23,\"line\":26}}},\"label\":\"regex\"},\"session_name\":\"rust-analyzer\"}",
